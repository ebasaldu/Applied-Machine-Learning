# Applied-Machine-Learning
The main intent of this Project was to create a Convolutional Neural Network that would take in a Large Feed of American Sign Language Hand signs and map each Image to the respective letter in the Alphabet 
This was done both through the development of 2 Models. One built from the bottom up and the other implemented Transfer Learning with the use of a VGG16 Model.

This repository includes:
The python notebook with the code for the main CNN , some visualizations, Data Prep, Training Execution and Graphs for comparisons in Accuracy and Loss.

A report which goes into detail about the objectives, Dataset preparation , Challenges , the Developement of the CNN model, breakdown of model infastructure, and analysis of results. 

The data set the model was trained on was borrowed from Kaggle.The Training set and Validation set were both derived from this.
